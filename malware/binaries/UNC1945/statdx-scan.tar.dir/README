******************************************************************
Forgive me father...for i have sinned. 
I have created the lamest possible thing upon this very planet.
the StatdX scanner. Really all this is, is a couple sh scripts with
Volatiles pscan... edited to scan for rpc.statd.

KEEP IN MIND ---- THIS GROUP OF FILES WAS _NOT_ CREATED FOR PEOPLE WHO 
MAKE BAD CHOICES. I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE DOES
WITH THIS GROUP OF FILES.

******************************************************************

to install this scanner...all you have to do is './install'
and it should work out nicely.
if not..dont come bitching to me!
if the install script doesnt work for some ODD reason....
compile the .c's manualy.

once everything is installed, just simple do this:

1.) ./pscan <class b> 111 --- (i.e, ./pscan 255.255 111)

once that is finished,

2.) ./osscan 

3.) cat os.log will show you the 'refined' hosts. 
    i usualy do 'cat os.log |grep "wu"', which will show you the majority of the vulnerable box's.

4.) i really hope you can figure this part out. (hint: ./statdx -t <ip/host> -d <system type>)
